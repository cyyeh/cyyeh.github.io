I believe that achievement really comes from daily practices, and with good daily habits comes with good daily practices. You can treat this book as a reference, not a textbook. Everyone is unique anyway, but you can try their strategies first, then adjust them until you find yourself comfortable and in flow.

- I realized that I could buy the best mechanical keyboards, go to the most famous tech conferences in the world, and learn all the newest frameworks. Still, if I cultivated bad habits, it would be impossible to become a top developer. Because of that, I decided to reach out to the best developers I know and ask them tips on how to be more productive.
- Consistency matters, and that same concept applies to your professional career as well. Things take time, and intensity is not always the answer. The habits you decide to cultivate (or not cultivate) will determine your future life opportunities.
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.
- I often get emails from other software engineers asking what programming language they should learn. And while that’s a very important question to ask, I feel like a more valuable question would be: “What habits do I need to cultivate in order to be effective in any programming language?
