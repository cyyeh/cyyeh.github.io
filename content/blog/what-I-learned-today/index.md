## What this post is about?

I believe that achievement only comes from deliberate and consistent hard work being practiced every day. If we record down every detail of what we learned along the path, we may find out that the success is really not a miracle. It doesn't come from no where, but comes from dots connected along your life journey. Steve Jobs once said, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. However, I think it's not true for knowledge development(management). You may somehow figure out some clues of what you already know, what you actually don't know or what you want to know in the future, etc., then you can better prepare for yourself for the future, at least for learning's sake. 

This list should be a living document that fulfills my incomplete arguments, and I'll try my best to keep it up to date and improve it if possible along my lifelong journey.

  <summary>JavaScript to Know for React</summary>

  https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react

  **Abstract**

  Modern frontend frameworks such as React use JavaScript a lot. 
  Not only you can write application logic using JavaScript, 
  you can also "write" HTML using JavaScript such as [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and CSS using JavaScript such as [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). 
  This blog post is a collection of key JavaScript concepts you should be familiar with if you would like to develop modern JavaScript applications.

  **Key Takeaways**

  1. template literals
  2. shorthand property names
  3. arrow functions
  4. destructuring
  5. parameter defaults
  6. rest/spread
  7. ESModules
  8. ternaries
  9. array methods
  10. nullish coalescing operator
  11. optional chaining
  12. promises and async/await

  <summary>Art of Abstraction</summary>

  https://www.merrickchristensen.com/articles/abstraction/

  **Abstraction**

  Dealing with complexity is one of the most important topics in the field of computer science. 
  Abstraction can be said the most important technique for managing complexity. You can even said that 
  all computer systems are made of layers of abstraction from hardware to software. This article mainly 
  discusses abstraction in software people's point of view. Having a good conceptual model towards
  different levels of abstraction helps you have more clear strategies on dealing with ongoing software development challenges. This article also references some interesting articles worth reading. In short, [avoid hasty abstractions](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming) and [having no abstraction is better than having wrong abstractions](https://youtu.be/4anAwXYqLG8?t=802).

  <summary>One React mistake that's slowing you down</summary>

  https://epicreact.dev/one-react-mistake-thats-slowing-you-down/

  **Abstract**

  This article concisely gives a good usage of composition capabilities provided by React. With proper layout provided, we may even don't need more complex tools to solve the [prop drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling) issue, instead we can avoid the issue from coming up first!
