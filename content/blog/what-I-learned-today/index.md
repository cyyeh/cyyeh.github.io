### What this post is about?

I believe that achievement only comes from deliberate and consistent hard work being practiced every day. If we record down every detail of what we learned along the path, we may find out that the success is really not a miracle. It doesn't come from no where, but comes from dots connected along your life journey. Steve Jobs once said, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. However, I think it's not true for knowledge development(management). You may somehow figure out some clues of what you already know, what you actually don't know or what you want to know in the future, etc., then you can better prepare for yourself for the future, at least for learning's sake. 

This list should be a living document that fulfills my incomplete arguments, and I'll try my best to keep it up to date and improve the proves along my lifelong journey.
