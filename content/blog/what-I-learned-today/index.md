## What is this post about?

I believe that achievement only comes from deliberate and consistent hard work being practiced every day. If we record down every detail of what we learned along the path, we may find out that the success is really not a miracle. It doesn't come from no where, but comes from dots connected along your life journey. Steve Jobs once said, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. However, I think it's not true for knowledge development(management). You may somehow figure out some clues of what you already know, what you actually don't know or what you want to know in the future, etc., then you can better prepare for yourself for the future, at least for learning's sake. 

This list should be a living document that fulfills my incomplete arguments, and I'll try my best to keep it up to date and improve it if possible along my lifelong journey.

  <summary>Marty Cagan - The Nature of Product</summary>

https://youtu.be/T3VRz18ntjQ

Abstract

During this keynote talk I'll be calling out some of the most important and deeply rooted misconceptions about how great products are created.

We'll be discussing the difference between an idea and a product; the difference between implementing features and solving problems for our customers in ways that work for our business; the difference between product owners and true product managers; the difference between product teams and feature teams; the difference between scaling with process and scaling with leadership; and more generally, the differences between how the best product companies in the world work, and how the rest work. Finally, we'll be talking about what's involved in truly changing how you work from the rest to the best.

Kï»¿ey Takeaways

1. You need to solve a problem nobody has solved before
    * Most companies are working on old problems

2. You need to spend as much time as possible understanding "the problem space"
    * Ben Horowitz: The primary thing that any technology startup must do is build a product that's at least 10 times better at doing something than the current prevailing way of doing that thing

3. You need to be an expert in the domain
    * Shreyas Doshi: True domain expertise is domain knowledge minus domain dogma

4. You need to listen to your customers
    * Jeff Bezos: No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime Membership program

5. You need to commit to your solution, and iterate until success
    * Kaaren Hanson: Fall in love with the problem, not the solution

6. You need product owners
    * Marty Cagan: A product owner is simply a role in a delivery process. A product manager is responsible for a product's value and viability
    * Designers -> usability
    * Engineers -> feasibility
    * Product Managers -> value and viability

7. You need to come up with innovative product ideas
    * Steve Jobs: The disease of thinking that an idea is 90% of the work

8. You need your engineers to focus on coding
    * Steve Jobs: We don't hire all these engineers to tell them what to do; we hire them to show us what's possible

9. You need to focus on creating a product your customers love
    * Martina Lauchengco: One of the biggest mistakes I see companies make is not thinking about both the product and the market side of product/market fit

10. You need process people to grow your company
    * Elon Musk: The problem is that a lot of big companies, process becomes a substitute for thinking
